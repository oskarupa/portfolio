        <h3>FBP DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY</h3>
        <p>Overall, my strategy for the final semester of Y3 is to transform from a technologically skilled maker into a <strong>Balanced Designer</strong>. My goal for the Final Bachelor Project is to use my core strengths in Technology & Realization and MDC to develop and explore all the other expertise areas. Instead of treating the final prototype as the main goal, I will use my rapid prototyping skills as a tool for research and validation.</p>
        
        <p>My plan is to join either the <strong>Artifice</strong> or <strong>New Futures</strong> Squad. I will design a system that explores human-computer interaction (e.g., AI + Creativity or Home + Health). Most importantly, the process will be guided by making rapid prototypes to make valuable decisions and findings.</p>

    <div class="future-plans">
        <h3>1. STATUS OF LONG-TERM GOALS</h3>
        <p>Reviewing the goals set at the start of Year 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal: Become confident in Unity for prototyping digital interactions.</strong><br>
                <em>Status:</em> While I achieved competence in Unity (Game Design 1 & 2), B3.1 saw a pivot to a new program, Touch Designer for real time visualization. I have successfully proven I can adapt to new tech solutions and expanded my digital prototyping toolkit.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Goal: Explore augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) as tools for inclusive interaction.</strong><br>
                <em>Status:</em> Potential for FBP. Since my project 3, I have not worked with AR/VR headsets as an interaction, but there is certainly so much potential to explore this area. However, its not my sole interest and I would not limit myself to this.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Goal: Improve reflection and planning skills.</strong><br>
                <em>Status:</em> Needs work. B3.1 project demonstrated that with enough effort and motivation, especially in Q1, I held to a reflective design process that involved small iterations each week. However, when it came to planning my Q2 to work towards a final prototype, I underestimated how long it would take to integrate everything.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="future-plans">
        <h3>2. FBP COMPETENCE PLAN</h3>
        <p>How I will address specific expertise areas in the FBP:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User & Society:</strong> I need to avoid the "build first, test later" mindset that I had for B3.1. I will build a probe or a low-fidelity tech prototype in the first 3 weeks. I will use this to conduct a user study to validate the concept and interaction before making my own plans for how the project should go.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Creativity & Aesthetics:</strong> Making creative decisions will be about making 3 or more alternatives. In B3.1, I used an engineering process (designing one solution). In my FBP, I will use my technical skills to quickly make three interaction prototypes (for example, sliders vs. screens vs. gestures) to test and analyze strengths and weaknesses. This will be a creative process.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Business & Entrepreneurship:</strong> The plan is to define the context(s) of my project. I can treat the FBP as a client project. Even if the client is hypothetical, I will define a specific Value Proposition and Target Demographic in the ideation phase, ensuring the product involves a potential market need.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="future-plans">
        <h3>3. NEW SMART GOALS FOR FBP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal 1 (U&S):</strong> By Week 4 of Q3, I will conduct a user test with at least 5 participants using a low fidelity probe or prototype I created to validate the value proposition I set.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Goal 2 (C&A):</strong> Create more than one (min. 3) integrated prototypes. For the midterm demoday, instead of having one demonstrator, have variations and explore how feedback and experience is different between them.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Goal 3 (Documentation):</strong> Throughout the second semester, I will document the process in detail, highlighting each iteration and reflecting on a weekly basis.</li>
