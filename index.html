                <h2>Professional Identity</h2>
                <p>As an Industrial Designer, I'm interested in creating meaningful products that combine interaction of the physical and digital world. I bring playfulness, creativity, and the ability to realize the technology of my projects.</p>

                <p>I look at design through the lens of playful interactions, I believe games hold core principles that apply to all interactive experiences. Especially products that combine physical and digital space.</p>

                <p>This year, I expanded my technical toolkit beyond Unity into Generative AI. I learnt to treat code and data as raw materials for design. My goal for the rest of my studies is to evolve from a maker into a Balanced Designer. I will apply my digital craftsmanship to physical products based on user needs and contexts.</p>

                    <p>Gen Abstract is a physical interface designed to experiment with image generation as a tactile process instead of a text-based one. I designed a system where users manipulate AI-generated GLSL code using physical sliders and knobs.</p>
                    <p>This was my first big individual project, and I used the freedom to use my strengths and design a highly technical prototype, both physically and digitally. However, this had the downside of not exploring other expertise areas even when possible.</p>

                    <p>Pointless was created as part of Project 2, where the assignment was to create an interactive companion. Our goal was to experiment with 'unnatural' methods of communicating emotions.</p>
                    <p>The tetrahedron communicates it's state using it's shape changing abilities. Based on the proximity of the user's hand, Pointless will change the aggressiveness and direction of it's movements.</p>
                    <p>Pointless reacts to the proximity of the human hand and uses an array of servos to individually control triangular faces. My coding and creative electronics abilities greatly influenced the outcome of the prototype. I believe the final result is a great example of a strong interactive experience.</p>

                    <h3>SNEK Game</h3>
                    <p>Snek Game is a simple but challenging game created using Processing. The goal of the game is to navigate a snake character through increasingly difficult levels with varying obstacles.</p>
                    <p>The game allows multiple players to play on the same device for an added level of difficulty and competition. There can be a maximum of three snakes – where one is controlled by the WASD keys, one is controlled by the arrow keys, and one is controlled by a Joystick connected to an Arduino.</p>
                    <p>I believe games should provide the player with tools to create their own challenges and share them with others. To accompany SNEK game, and to help me design levels, I created a level editor which saves levels as files that can be imported and used in the game.</p>

The box is designed to house a phone camera that records the story from below.</p>
                    <p>For me, Memory Box is an powerful project that demonstrated how an interactive game can use creativity to promote social connections that matter.</p>
                    <p>During user testing, we found that creating a visual while telling a story makes it easier to understand and to tell.</p>

                    <p>Along with designing the user interface of the digital platform, I designed the logo, icons and all UI elements.</p>
                    <p>To put everything together, I created an interactive prototype in Sketch to allow people to experience the website during Demo Day.</p>
                    <p>The logo represents the family tree. It acts as a reference to the structured representation of the family hierarchy and has a visual resemblance to the user interface.</p>

                    <h3>Taxi Boss Brand Identity</h3>
                    <p>Over the many years of Taxi Boss being updated and active, I developed a strong visual style that links branding, game art and user interface elements. I believe a visual style can greatly affect the experience of playing a game.</p>
                    <p>I designed the entirety of the Taxi Boss User Interface ranging from menus to widgets. I believe designing game interfaces is an interesting challenge due to the cross-platform nature of Roblox games. I designed elements that would work on mobile, desktop, and console.</p>
