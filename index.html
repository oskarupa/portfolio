                <h2>Industrial Design Student</h2>
                <p>As part of my study, I'm interested in creating meaningful products that combine interaction of the physical and digital world. I bring playfulness, creativity and the ability to realize the technology of my projects.</p>
                <p>I am most skilled in creative coding, electronics prototyping, and game design. My experience shaped me as a game designer, but my passion is in all interactive experiences. I like building projects that combine the physical and digital.</p>
                <p>I want to focus on projects that utilize the newest technology like AR and VR, while keeping core principles that make games interactive.</p>

                    <h3>Taxi Boss</h3>
                    <p>Taxi Boss is a top charting driving/roleplaying/management game with a custom-built open world city, where players deliver increasingly demanding customers and slowly build their own taxi empire.</p>
                    <p>I started developing the game with my brother, as we grew we expanded our team and now have a team working on 3D models, community management and testing.</p>
                    <p>We collaborated with Jimmy Fallon to promote his 2024 Holiday album on Roblox, through Taxi Boss exclusively. This experience has taught me the challenges of working with big brands and companies.</p>

                    <h3>Brand Identity & User Interface Design</h3>
                    <p>Over the many years of Taxi Boss being updated and active, I developed a strong visual style that links branding, game art and user interface elements. I believe a visual style can greatly affect the experience of playing a game.</p>
                    <p>I designed the entirety of the Taxi Boss User Interface ranging from menus to widgets. I believe designing game interfaces is an interesting challenge due to the cross-platform nature of Roblox games. I designed elements that would work on mobile, desktop, and console.</p>

                    <p>Memory Box is a digital and physical educational game that brings families together to expand on the storytelling experience. The design includes a wooden box with a translucent top. Included are transparent elements, that the players use to visually demonstrate their stories. The box is designed to house a phone camera that records the story from below.</p>
                    <p>For me, Memory Box is an powerful project that demonstrated how an interactive game can use creativity to promote social connections that matter.</p>
                    <p>During user testing, we found that creating a visual while telling a story makes it easier to understand and to tell.</p>

                    <h3>SNEK Game</h3>
                    <p>Snek Game is a simple but challenging game created using Processing. The goal of the game is to navigate a snake character through increasingly difficult levels with varying obstacles.</p>
                    <p>The game allows multiple players to play on the same device for an added level of difficulty and competition. There can be a maximum of three snakes – where one is controlled by the WASD keys, one is controlled by the arrow keys, and one is controlled by a Joystick connected to an Arduino.</p>
                    <p>I believe games should provide the player with tools to create their own challenges and share them with others. To accompany SNEK game, and to help me design levels, I created a level editor which saves levels as files that can be imported and used in the game.</p>

                    <h3>Pointless</h3>
                    <p>Pointless was created as part of Project 2, where the assignment was to create an interactive companion. Our goal was to experiment with 'unnatural' methods of communicating emotions.</p>
                    <p>The tetrahedron communicates it's state using it's shape changing abilities. Based on the proximity of the user's hand, Pointless will change the aggressiveness and direction of it's movements.</p>
                    <p>Pointless reacts to the proximity of the human hand and uses an array of servos to individually control triangular faces. My coding and creative electronics abilities greatly influenced the outcome of the prototype. I believe the final result is a great example of a strong interactive experience.</p>
