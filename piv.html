                <p>I did so many activities, projects, and points of reflection. I could find endless connections between different expertise areas and projects. That is why I decided to format it differently, and more easily â€“ Top learning moments for each EA. There were many more, but these are the ones that left a strong mark in my development.</p>

                    <p>During the course, I felt a large disconnection between my focus in design and sustainability. As a game and digital experience designer, I did not feel like sustainability is an important aspect of my work. However, when it got to the final reflection, I started thinking more, and started creating my own perspectives on what sustainability means for game design.</p>

                    <p>I did not enjoy what this course entails, as I am not interested in design research. But creating a 'probe kit' that we then had to release into the wild was a refreshing experience. It made me realize how little human contact with strangers I have with my current projects.</p>

                    <p>During demo day, we had a lot of interest of students and visitors wanting to try our app and what It's like to use AR. It was a great learning experience, with lots of frustration when people didn't immediately understand how to use our app. It showed how there is still so much to develop to make AR and VR a user-friendly interface. However, the biggest blow came when one of our assessors refused to put on the headset, that it makes her dizzy. This was a realization how these devices may be the future for some, but for many it's not accessible.</p>

                    <h4><span class="learning-number">1</span> Aesthetics of Interaction</h4>
                    <p>Aesthetics of Interaction was a course that taught me a lot about the theory behind interaction design, but I am not at all happy with the result we made. We got a good grade, and the chair that wakes you up by breaking was an out-of-the box concept and idea, but it goes against who I am as a designer. Luckily, I am in the process of taking the course Design Actuated Systems, that is much more promising on making something useful.</p>

                    <h4><span class="learning-number">2</span> DAF AR User Interface</h4>
                    <p>Designing a user interface for an AR app was a challenge. In the end, we decided to use these virtual 3D buttons that you need to 'physically' press. It is much better than the fake 'virtual' touch screens. I liked the result, but the lack of haptic feedback worsens the experience from a real button. Overall, the experience showed that there is still so much to explore in terms of designing virtual user interfaces for AR and VR and the topic became something I am interested in for the future.</p>

It was my plan last year to dedicate a whole semester to Unity. Overall, it was a very important skill development process for me that I plan on utilizing in my career.</p>

                    <p>This course taught me 2 main things. First is that there are so many tools that I now know to use to use in the design process. The second learning experience is the skill of presenting value propositions. Every week we had to prepare a presentation and every time the main challenge was making what we are proposing clear in a short time frame.</p>

                    <p>During Project 3, our squad had a workshop called 'Creating Real World Impact'. It was a very valuable workshop that showed how thinking about the business of my designs should not be an afterthought, but a valuable tool in the design process. Thinking about the marketability of a product brought new ideas to the project.</p>

                    <p>Presenting, at this point I believe I much more confident with pitching, public speaking and presenting. I find it easy to pitch an idea or topic, but much harder to pitch myself, and that is what I need to work on more.</p>
