                    <p>In the first two years of Industrial design, my development was leading me to finding a specific area within the broad field of ID. Year 1 was about exploring general competencies, while Year 2 was about personalizing my development. I immediately focused on my technical foundations in game design and built my professional identity around that.</p>

        <p>While previous years were mostly about acquiring skills, my B3.1 was about testing them in contrasting environments. I balanced a mostly technical individual project with collaborative electives. Overall, while it was helpful at highlighting the differences in how I work when building technology vs. designing meaningful products. The goal of my FBP will be to combine both approaches into one project.</p>

                    <p>With my B31 Squad project, I learnt the vulnerabilities of working alone. Without teammates I gained full individual freedom to plan my focus and work on ideas that interest me. However, I also learnt how I can fall into an engineering mindset. Getting too focused on the functionality of my prototype resulted in me only working towards getting it done instead of making smaller iterations, gathering feedback, and making changes. It also limited my development of other experience areas by focusing only on what I am good at.</p>

                    <p>Digital Craftsmanship: In this elective, I understood the high potential of the combination of two expertise areas: MDC and CA. We worked on a project where we gathered data on our physical movement patterns, specifically walking outside. We used programming explorations to create nature-inspired digital visualizations of the data and explored how to physically materialize them into a designed bag. We used the generated patterns as a template to hand sew them using different fabrics. This elective is a clear example of using one expertise area I’m good at to further develop in another (MDC -> CA), a practice that I plan on experiencing in my FBP.</p>

                    <p>I developed mostly in creativity and aesthetics through the connection to other expertise areas. I’m beginning to understand the value of this expertise area.
In Gen Abstract, aesthetics was defined by interaction, sliders, knobs and how the program responded visually in real time.
In Digital Craftsmanship, aesthetics was built around creatively visualizing data we gathered. By using a generative visualization, we not only communicate the data, but also our inspiration of patterns found in nature.

                    <p>Here, I learnt the power of first impressions and intuition when designing. Often through different academic learning activities (for example the marketing course), I thought professional design decisions should be based on studies, user tests, and data. In futures thinking a different technique was explored, using our designer intuition. When going through hundreds of appliances, we sorted them based on feelings. When mapping the perception of brands by consumers, we used our own opinions. Overall, it was a powerful realization that difficult design decisions can be made through these methods.</p>

                    <p>In year one, the curriculum was fully planned for me, leaving little choice for myself to plan my development. I did not mind this, as I was satisfied with the learning activities. However, for year 2, I had to choose my electives as well as a squad for the group project. I went all in on game design, a decision that had both its positives and negatives. I am happy about my development as an interaction designer, and successfully completed my goal of improving my Unity skills. However, retrospectively, I wish I could have developed more in more physical design skills. </p>

                    <p>For the first semester of Year 2, I joined the student team TU/ecomotive. It was a valuable experience, but took a significant amount of energy and time, developing my sketching skills, but at the cost of being less available for university work. I left the student team for the second semester, because I realized not giving everything to my study projects will result in me developing less.
I encountered a similar situation planning B3.1, I had the opportunity to do an internship where I would use my game development skills or Roblox experience. However, I was very adamant on working in an environment where I develop as an Industrial Designer, and not a game developer or marketer. The limited design studios that would provide this development were not interested in me.

A key change I made in year 2 from year 1 is reflecting regularly on my study choices. I reflected after Q2 that led me to leave the student team and change my PI&V, and I reflected in Q4 on how I present my portfolio and what are my goals for next year. However, one of my SMART goals for next year is to reflect every quartile on everything I’m doing leading to graduation. I want my FBP to be unique, impressive, and memorable. For that I will need to make the right choices for the squad and idea. My overall main goal is to develop my portfolio through working on projects that utilize the skills I learnt with digital prototyping to use in physical interactive products.</p>

                        <p>During the course, I felt a lack of connection between my focus in design and sustainability.

While the core concept felt abstract, creating, and releasing a 'probe kit' into the real world turned out to be a refreshing experience. It highlighted how rarely I engage directly with strangers in my projects, and made me realize the potential of using playful, indirect methods to gather insights.

Some people struggled to understand how to interact with the virtual elements, which highlighted how much work is still needed to make AR feel natural. One moment that stood out was when an assessor chose not to try the headset due to motion discomfort, it was a reminder that these technologies aren’t accessible to everyone. Rather than seeing this as a problem, it sparked my interest in designing alternative augmented interaction methods that are more inclusive and don’t rely on headsets. This experience helped deepen my vision for the future from a User & Society perspective and its importance in interaction design.</p>

                        <p>The Aesthetics of Interaction course gave me insights into the theory behind interaction design. Our final concept, a chair that wakes you up by collapsing, was bold and unconventional. While it challenged me creatively, I realized it didn't align with my vision of designing purposeful interactions. This helped me understand where I stand as a designer. I want to create interactions that are unique and playful, but also useful and relevant. This realization is what led me to take the elective Design Actuated Systems, where I’m now focused on designing functional haptic interactions.</p>

                        <p>Designing a user interface for an AR app was a challenge. In the end, we decided to use virtual 3D buttons that users would 'physically' press. It offers a more unique interaction than floating virtual touch screens. I liked the result, but the lack of haptic feedback worsens the experience from a real button. This experience showed me how much there is still to explore in designing virtual interfaces for AR and VR. It deepened my interest in the topic, especially as I started seeing the connection to User & Society — creating interactions that are both engaging and accessible for a diverse range of users is a meaningful design challenge.</p>

                <div class="competence-intro"></div>
                    I see Math, Data and Computing as the backbone of responsive and adaptive systems. While it may not always be visible to the user, it’s essential for creating satisfying interactions that react intelligently to user input.

                    <div class="learning-body">
                        <p>In the course Intelligent Interactive Products, I learnt how to use machine learning models together with real-time sensor data (accelerometer, microphone). I utilized the open-ended individual assignment to explore my identity as a playful interaction designer by creating a pretend-cooking experience for children. Physical interactions were detected with feedback in a motivating virtual interface. This small project was my first experience of aligning my designs with my new professional identity. It represents the ideas I want to pursue in more detail in the third year.</p>

                    <p>It was my intention to focus on other expertise areas in year 2, as I felt I was stronger in MDC and had less experience in other expertise areas. However, this year I found out how strong the connection of this expertise is to Creativity and Aesthetics, specifically creating aesthetic interactions. For example, in the course Intelligent Interactive Products, we created smart gesture controls that utilized accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data to control a camera.</p>

                <h3>BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</h3>

                <div class="competence-intro"></div>
                    I see Business and Entrepreneurship as understanding how to turn creative ideas into sellable products. As a designer, I want my designs to affect as much people as possible, and for that they have to provide value. In Year 2, my perspective on this expertise area changed significantly.

                    <h4><span class="learning-number">1</span> Games and Play Workshop</h4>
                    <p>During Project 3, our squad had a workshop called 'Creating Real World Impact'. It was a valuable workshop that showed how thinking about the business of my designs should not be an afterthought, but a valuable tool during the design process. Thinking about the marketability of a product brought ideas through a new perspective. Before, I believed any good product could be eventually brought to market, but now I see how Business and Entrepreneurship is a vital expertise area to utilize during the design process.</p>

                <div class="learning-moment">
                    <h4><span class="learning-number">2</span> Design Innovation Methods</h4>
                    <p>The business focused course Design Innovation Method taught me 2 main things. Firstly, there are so many tools that I now know to use in the design process, not only for business design but for creating valuable ideas. 
The second learning experience is the skill of presenting value propositions. Every week we had to prepare a presentation and every time the main challenge was making what we are proposing clear in a short time frame. It showed the strong connection of this expertise area to Professional Skills such as pitching to convince others of my ideas.

                <h3>PROFESSIONAL SKILLS</h3>

                <div class="competence-intro">
                    I see Professional Skills as the foundation that supports all other areas of design. Communicating, reflecting, and collaborating. In Year 2, I made conscious efforts to strengthen my soft skills, particularly in presenting and self-reflection and collaboration, which were weaker areas in Year 1.

                <div class="learning-moment">
                    <h4><span class="learning-number">1</span> Presenting and Pitching</h4>
                    <p>In Year 1, I often felt nervous explaining my ideas. In Year 2, I became more confident through frequent opportunities to pitch concepts — especially during the Design Innovation Methods course and the pitching workshop before demo day. Currently, I find it easy to pitch an idea or topic, but much harder to pitch myself, and that is what I need to work on more. This will be essential for my FBP.</p>

                <div class="learning-moment">
                    <h4><span class="learning-number">2</span> Reflection Ability</h4>
                    <p>Reflection used to a challenge for me. In Year 1, my reflections were often shallow or unsure, simply summarizing what happened. In Year 2, I made major improvements. One example is my reflection on Sustainability and Design, where I critically analyzed my disconnect with the topic and created my own interpretation of its relevance. Writing that reflection felt natural, and it helped me realize that reflection works best when it's personal and honest.</p>
