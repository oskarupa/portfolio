                <div class="learning-body">
                    <p>In Year 1, I was not as active in group discussions and design decisions. I often took an easy way out by doing a specific part of the work, such as code. That changed significantly in the first semester of Year 2. In the DAF AR project, our coach was not strict, and I had to push harder to bring our group together and on track. In the electives game design 1 and game design 2, I had the most expertise, becoming a leader in my groups, planning, delegating tasks and always being available to help others. This growth was put to the test for the multidisciplinary project at the end of Q4, where I was placed in a very different environment, being the only student of ID in a group of Physics and Electrical Engineering students. I played towards my strengths and was a key member providing valuable insights from my expertise while having less knowledge in the scientific theory of the project.</p>

                <div class="learning-body">
                    <p>The DAF AR project was my first experience of working for a client on a design solving their problem. I quickly understood it’s very different to what I experienced in Year 1. Initially, I felt restricted by what I thought the client wants, thinking less creatively. I learnt that a designer must stand by his ideas and will most likely not match the client’s expectations. It is my job as a designer to come up with something new and convince the client it is the way to go. This was an extremely valuable insight that I am grateful for, as it is not standard for projects in Year 2 to be like mine.</p>

                    <p>While I improved significantly in leading and collaborating during specific courses, I still have a lot to improve. I’ve identified two pain points in group work. When there is active group with dominant members, I don’t voice my opinions enough. For example, our Aesthetics of Interaction project was well graded, but did not align with my personal design ideas and professional identity. The other situation is when a team lacks momentum due to other academic pressures. This happened during the Design Actuated Systems elective where we clearly were not active enough to meet deadlines. I now realize I should have stepped up and taken more initiative to motivate the group. Going into Year 3, I need to improve in these areas, it’s my last opportunity to get quality design experience.</p>

                    <p>In year one, the curriculum was fully planned for me, leaving little choice for myself to plan my development. I did not mind this, as I was satisfied with the learning activities. However, for year 2, I had to choose my electives as well as a squad for the group project. I went all in on game design, a decision that had both its positives and negatives. I am happy about my development as an interaction designer, and successfully completed my goal of improving my Unity skills. However, retrospectively, I wish I could have developed more in more physical design skills. </p>

                <div class="learning-body">
                    <p>For the first semester of Year 2, I joined the student team TU/ecomotive. It was a valuable experience, but took a significant amount of energy and time, developing my sketching skills, but at the cost of being less available for university work. I left the student team for the second semester, because I realized not giving everything to my study projects will result in me developing less.
I encountered a similar situation planning B3.1, I had the opportunity to do an internship where I would use my game development skills or Roblox experience. However, I was very adamant on working in an environment where I develop as an Industrial Designer, and not a game developer or marketer. The limited design studios that would provide this development were not interested in me.

                    <p>Looking ahead, I will be more intentional with planning my Year 3. I build my PDP around combining digital prototyping with physical interactive products. A key change I made in year 2 from year 1 is reflecting regularly on my study choices. I reflected after Q2 that led me to leave the student team and change my PI&V, and I reflected in Q4 on how I present my portfolio and what are my goals for next year. However, one of my SMART goals for next year is to reflect every quartile on everything I’m doing leading to graduation. I want my FBP to be unique, impressive, and memorable. For that I will need to make the right choices for the squad and idea. My overall main goal is to develop my portfolio through working on projects that utilize the skills I learnt with digital prototyping to use in physical interactive products.</p>

                        <p>During the course, I felt a lack of connection between my focus in design and sustainability. As a game and digital experience designer, I did think of sustainability as my main focus. However, only once I was reflecting on what I learnt, I started seeing the connections between environmental sustainability and my own perspectives on sustainable, long lasting, game design. This was a perfect example of how the Professional Skill of reflecting is important for developing in other EAs.</p>

                        <p>The Design Research course challenged me to leave my comfort zone. While the core concept felt abstract, creating, and releasing a 'probe kit' into the real world turned out to be a refreshing experience. It highlighted how rarely I engage directly with strangers in my projects, and made me realize the potential of using playful, indirect methods to gather insights. This exercise expanded my view of what research can look like in design.</p>

                        <p>During demo day, we received a lot of positive interest from students and visitors curious to experience our AR app. It also revealed how challenging it can be to make emerging technology intuitive for all users. Some people struggled to understand how to interact with the virtual elements, which highlighted how much work is still needed to make AR feel natural. One moment that stood out was when an assessor chose not to try the headset due to motion discomfort, it was a reminder that these technologies aren’t accessible to everyone. Rather than seeing this as a problem, it sparked my interest in designing alternative augmented interaction methods that are more inclusive and don’t rely on headsets. This experience helped deepen my vision for the future from a User & Society perspective and its importance in interaction design.</p>

                    I see Creativity & Aesthetics as the heart of meaningful interaction. Not just visual but the feeling users get when they engage with my designs. In Year 2, I began to define my own aesthetic values, tightening my focus on the cross section between interacting with the digital and physical.

                        <p>The Aesthetics of Interaction course gave me insights into the theory behind interaction design. Our final concept, a chair that wakes you up by collapsing, was bold and unconventional. While it challenged me creatively, I realized it didn't align with my vision of designing purposeful interactions. This helped me understand where I stand as a designer. I want to create interactions that are unique and playful, but also useful and relevant. This realization is what led me to take the elective Design Actuated Systems, where I’m now focused on designing functional haptic interactions.</p>

                        <p>Designing a user interface for an AR app was a challenge. In the end, we decided to use virtual 3D buttons that users would 'physically' press. It offers a more unique interaction than floating virtual touch screens. I liked the result, but the lack of haptic feedback worsens the experience from a real button. This experience showed me how much there is still to explore in designing virtual interfaces for AR and VR. It deepened my interest in the topic, especially as I started seeing the connection to User & Society — creating interactions that are both engaging and accessible for a diverse range of users is a meaningful design challenge.</p>

                        <p>In the course Intelligent Interactive Products, I learnt how to use machine learning models together with real-time sensor data (accelerometer, microphone). I utilized the open-ended individual assignment to explore my identity as a playful interaction designer by creating a pretend-cooking experience for children. Physical interactions were detected with feedback in a motivating virtual interface. This small project was my first experience of aligning my designs with my new professional identity. It represents the ideas I want to pursue in more detail in the third year.</p>

However, this year I found out how strong the connection of this expertise is to Creativity and Aesthetics, specifically creating aesthetic interactions. For example, in the course Intelligent Interactive Products, we created smart gesture controls that utilized accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data to control a camera.</p>

                    I see Business and Entrepreneurship as understanding how to turn creative ideas into sellable products.

                    <p>During Project 3, our squad had a workshop called 'Creating Real World Impact'. It was a valuable workshop that showed how thinking about the business of my designs should not be an afterthought, but a valuable tool during the design process. Thinking about the marketability of a product brought ideas through a new perspective. Before, I believed any good product could be eventually brought to market, but now I see how Business and Entrepreneurship is a vital expertise area to utilize during the design process.</p>

The second learning experience is the skill of presenting value propositions. Every week we had to prepare a presentation and every time the main challenge was making what we are proposing clear in a short time frame. It showed the strong connection of this expertise area to Professional Skills such as pitching to convince others of my ideas.

                    I see Professional Skills as the foundation that supports all other areas of design. Communicating, reflecting, and collaborating. In Year 2, I made conscious efforts to strengthen my soft skills, particularly in presenting and self-reflection and collaboration, which were weaker areas in Year 1.

                    <p>In Year 1, I often felt nervous explaining my ideas. In Year 2, I became more confident through frequent opportunities to pitch concepts — especially during the Design Innovation Methods course and the pitching workshop before demo day. Currently, I find it easy to pitch an idea or topic, but much harder to pitch myself, and that is what I need to work on more. This will be essential for my FBP.</p>

                    <p>Reflection used to a challenge for me. In Year 1, my reflections were often shallow or unsure, simply summarizing what happened. In Year 2, I made major improvements. One example is my reflection on Sustainability and Design, where I critically analyzed my disconnect with the topic and created my own interpretation of its relevance. Writing that reflection felt natural, and it helped me realize that reflection works best when it's personal and honest.</p>
